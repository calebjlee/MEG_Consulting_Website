                            A case interview looks at a hypothetical business problem and asks the interviewee to solve the issue. Common business issues case interviews will look at are profitability, market sizing, mergers and acquisition, and business expansion.
                            <br/><br/> For club recruiting most cases revolve around profitability and market sizing. We'll give a brief overview of how to approach these types of cases and then have a short mock case so you can practice your skills.

                            To show the structure and key concepts that you need to know for your case interview, we'll go through a mock case found in the 2017 Edition of The Wharton Case Book. If you would like additional practice cases we can send you the case book, just email us at meg.eboard@umich.edu.
                            <br/><br/>We'll give you the mock case interview section by section, much like an actual interview, but in between sections we'll also show what we would expect from you for each part of the case interview.
                            <br/><br/> The only materials you'll need is a paper and pencil, nothing else. Let's get started!

                            A case interview starts with the interviewer giving a little bit of exposition on the business issue. Here is ours:
                            <br/><br/>
                            "Our client, Unicloth, is an Asian clothing retailer attempting to establish a
                            profitable presence in the United States. However, since they arrived five years
                            ago, they have struggled to achieve that goal and have engaged our firm to find
                            out why and to recommend next steps. How can we help?"
                            <br/><br/>
                            That's all you get! <u>How do you approach this case?</u> Write down or imagine what you would do if this prompt was given to you. When your done move on to the next slide to see what we think you should do.
                        </BodyText>
                    </TextContainer>
                    <ContentImage src={case1}/>
                </ContentContainer>
            </SlideContainer>

            <SlideContainer style={{transform: caseID >= 4 ? "translateX(0vw)": "translateX(100vw)" }}>
                <ContentContainer>
                <TextContainer>
                        <TitleText>Details and Questions</TitleText>
                        <SmallSpacer style={{height:"2vmax"}}/>
                        <BodyText>
                            Ok so as you can see you don't get a lot of starting info for a case. There are a few things you shouldn't do, most commonly, don't jump straight into a solution.
                            We want you to focus on two things: Details and Questions.
                            <br/><br/>
                            When the prompt is being read to you, take notes on all the details that might be important. You never know what is important in a case. What's the company name? What industry is the business in? What's the business issue? etc.
                            <br/><br/>
                            After you written down the details of the case, start brainstorming questions that might be important. What information is given that might be useful to your solution? Write some questions that you think are important. When you're ready, go to the next slide to see some questions we thought of.
                        </BodyText>
                    </TextContainer>
                    <ContentImage src={case1}/>
                </ContentContainer>
            </SlideContainer>

            <ChevronContainer>
